# Clash-Royale-Tournament-Bracket
A tournament generator for Clash Royale, a 1v1 real-time tower rush game played with an 8-card deck. The tournament generator has different game modes such as draft, classic, mirror, and build your own deck. The program utilizes a card list to generate random decks for each player. The players record their battle results through the program until there is one winner.
This project was cloned using Eclipse.
